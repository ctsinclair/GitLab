Here is the technical assignment, I was lazy and just used Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition to
code the two parts.

To compile and run the code you will need Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition which is free.

Directory layout is:
  Topology
  TopologyTest
  Transformers
  TransformersTest

To build the Topology assembly (contains the code to calculate the number of castles) open the solution
in the Topology directory and build. To run tests build the solution in TopologyTest.

To execute the tests: open the Test/Windows from the top ribbon and then select ‘Run all’ from the Test-Window.

To build the Transformers assembly (contains the code to run the battles) open the solution in the
Transformers directory and build.

To run the tests for Transformers build the solution in TransformersTest.

To execute the tests: open the 'Test/Windows/TestExplorer' from the top ribbon and then select “Run all”
from the Test Explorer.

To see the output of a test select the test and in the lower panel of the Test Window select the
highlighted word ‘output’. They did a great job of hiding the output.

To just view the code:
Part 1: src\Topology\Topology\Topology.cs
Part 2: src\Transformers\Transformers\Transformers.cs

Yours truly,
Craig
